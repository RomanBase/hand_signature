A Flutter plugin providing Signature Pad for drawing smooth signatures. Library is written in pure Dart/Flutter environment to provide support for all platforms..\
Easy to use library with variety of draw and export settings. Also supports SVG files.

![Structure](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RomanBase/hand_signature/master/doc/signature.png)

Signature pad drawing is based on Cubic BÃ©zier curves.\
Offers to choose between performance and beauty mode.

**Usage**
```dart
    import 'package:hand_signature/signature.dart';
```

With **HandSignatureControl** and **HandSignaturePainterView** is possible to tweak some drawing aspects like stroke width, smoothing ratio or velocity weight.
```dart
    final control = HandSignatureControl(
      threshold: 3.0,
      smoothRatio: 0.65,
      velocityRange: 2.0,
    );

    final widget = HandSignaturePainterView(
      control: control,
      color: Colors.blueGrey,
      width: 1.0,
      maxWidth: 10.0,
      type: SignatureDrawType.shape,
    );
```

**HandSignatureControl** sets up 'math' to control input touches and handles control points of signature curve.
- threshold: (LP) controls minimal distance between two points - higher distance creates smoother curve, but less precise. Higher distance also creates bigger input draw lag.
- smoothRatio: (0 - 1) controls how smooth curve will be - higher ratio creates smoother curve, but less precise. In most of cases are best results with values between 0.5 - 0.75.
- velocityRange: (LP per millisecond) controls curve size based on distance and duration between two points. Thin line - fast move, thick line - slow move. With higher velocityRange user must swing faster to draw thinner line.
- reverseVelocity: swaps stroke width. Thin line - slow move, thick line - fast move. Simply swaps min/max size based on velocity. 

**HandSignaturePainterView** sets up visual style of signature curve.
- control: processes input, handles math and stores raw data.
- color: just color of line.
- width: minimal width of line. Width at maximum swing speed (clamped by velocityRange).
- maxWidth: maximum width of line. Width at slowest swing speed.
- type: draw type of curve. Default and main draw type is **shape** - not so nice as **arc**, but has better performance. And **line** is simple path with uniform stroke width. 
  - line: basic Bezier line with best performance.
  - shape: like Ink drawn signature with still pretty good performance.
  - arc: beauty mode for Ink styled signature.

**Export**\
Properties, like canvas size, stroke min/max width and color can be modified during export.\
There are more ways and more formats how to export signature, most used ones are **svg** and **png** formats.
```dart
    final control = HandSignatureControl();

    final svg = control.toSvg();
    final png = control.toImage();
    final json = control.toMap();
    
    control.importData(json);
```
SVG: SignatureDrawType **shape** generates reasonably small file and is read well by all programs. On the other side **arc** generates really big svg file and some programs can have hard times handling so much objects. **Line** is simple Bezier Curve.\
Image: Export to image supports **ImageByteFormat** and provides png or raw rgba data.
Json/Map: Exports current state - raw data that can be used later to restore state.

**Parsing and drawing saved SVG**\
Exported **svg** is possible to display in classic [flutter_svg](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_svg) widget.\
Or use build in **HandSignatureView** for further line modifications.
```dart
    final widget = HandSignatureView.svg(
      data: svgString,
      strokeWidth: (width) => width * 0.35,
      padding: EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
      placeholder: Container(
        color: Colors.red,
        child: Center(
          child: Text('not signed yet'),
        ),
      ),
    );
```
Signature is automatically centered and fills given area.\
Currently stroke width can be controlled only for **line** and **arc** exports.\
**HandSignatureView** handles most of svg files, but is optimized for drawing signatures created with this library and don't provide all features like [flutter_svg](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_svg).

**Contribution**\
Any contribution is highly welcomed.\
Library is in good condition, but still in early development.\
Mainly to improve smoothing and line weight to better match real signature.\
Performance can be always better..\
Also currently there are no tests or documentation.

# Hand Signature

[![pub.dev](https://img.shields.io/pub/v/hand_signature.svg)](https://pub.dev/packages/hand_signature)

A Flutter plugin providing a Signature Pad for drawing smooth signatures. This library is written in a pure Dart/Flutter environment to provide support for all platforms. It's easy to use, with a variety of drawing and export settings, and also supports SVG files.

The signature pad drawing is based on Cubic BÃ©zier curves and offers a choice between performance and 'beauty' modes.

## Features

- **Cross-Platform:** Works on any platform supported by Flutter.
- **Customizable:** Adjust stroke width, color, and smoothing.
- **Multiple Drawing Types:** Choose between `line`, `shape`, and `arc` presets for different visual styles. It's also possible to implement a custom drawing experience.
- **Velocity and Pressure Based Stroke:** The thickness of the line can vary based on the drawing speed and pressure.
- **Export Options:** Export signatures as PNG, SVG, or raw data (JSON/Map).
- **Import/Export:** Save and load signature data state.

## Usage

Here is a simple example of how to use the signature pad.

```dart
final control = HandSignatureControl(
  initialSetup: SignaturePathSetup(
    threshold: 5.0,
    smoothRatio: 0.65,
    velocityRange: 2.0,
    pressureRatio: 0.0,
  ),
);

final widget = HandSignature(
  control: control,
  drawer: ShapeSignatureDrawer(
    color: Colors.blueGrey,
    width: 2.0,
    maxWidth: 10.0,
  ),
);
```

## `HandSignatureControl`

This class handles the logic behind the signature, controlling input touches and managing the control points of the signature curve.
**SignaturePathSetup** defines how input data will be handled.

- `threshold`: Controls the minimal distance between two points. A higher distance creates a smoother, but less precise, curve.
- `smoothRatio`: (0 - 1) Controls how smooth the curve will be. A higher ratio creates a smoother, but less precise, curve. The best results are typically between 0.5 and 0.75.
- `velocityRange`: Controls the curve size based on the drawing speed. A thin line corresponds to a fast movement, while a thick line corresponds to a slow movement.
- `presureRatio`: (0 - 1) Ratio between pressure sensitivity and velocity. 0.0 = only velocity, 1.0 = only pressure. Some platforms/devices (like mouse pointer) doesn't support sensitivity'
- `args`: Custom variables - mostly used for custom `HandSignatureDrawer`.

## `HandSignature`

This widget handles touch gestures and draws the curve on the canvas.

- `control`: The `HandSignatureControl` that processes input and stores the raw data.
- `drawer`: The `HandSignatureDrawer` that handles the painting of the signature.
- `backgroundColor`: The background color of the signature canvas.
- `placeholder`: A widget to display when the signature is empty.

---

## Drawers

Drawers are responsible for rendering the signature on the canvas. You can use one of the pre-built drawers or create your own.

### Pre-built Drawers
- `LineSignatureDrawer`: Basic line with a single line width.
- `ShapeSignatureDrawer`: Default drawer, mimics an ink pen. It varies line width based on velocity and/or pressure. This is a good option for exporting to SVG.
- `ArcSignatureDrawer`: Also mimics an ink pen, but is less performant than `ShapeSignatureDrawer`. This is the default drawer when exporting to an image.
- `DynamicSignatureDrawer`: Dynamically selects the drawing type based on provided arguments.
- `MultiSignatureDrawer`: Combines multiple drawers, allowing for complex effects and layering.

### Custom Drawer

You can create a custom drawer by extending `HandSignatureDrawer` and implementing the `paint` method. This allows full control over how the signature is rendered.

```dart
class MyCustomDrawer extends HandSignatureDrawer {
  @override
  void paint(Canvas canvas, Size size, List<CubicPath> paths) {
    // Custom painting logic here
  }
}
```

*Check `custom_sample.dart` for dynamic setup and drawing.*

## Exporting

You can modify properties like canvas size, stroke width, and color during export. You can also provide a custom drawer when exporting to an image. The most common export formats are SVG and PNG. During export, data are **re-rendered** with the preferred setup and output dimensions.

**State** can be saved with `toMap()` and restored with the `import()` method.

```dart
final control = HandSignatureControl();

// Export to SVG
final svg = control.toSvg();

// Export to PNG
final png = await control.toImage(
  width: 512,
  height: 512,
  drawer: ShapeSignatureDrawer(
    color: Colors.black,
  ),
);

// Export to raw data
final data = control.toMap();

// Import from raw data
control.import(data);
```

- **SVG**:
  - `shape`: Generates a reasonably small file that is well-supported by most programs.
  - `arc`: Generates a larger SVG file, which some programs may struggle to handle.
  - `line`: A simple Bezier curve.
- **Image**: Export to an `Image` or `Picture` object, which can then be converted to PNG bytes.
  - `arc`: Default drawer when exporting image data.
  - `drawer`: Specifies `HandSignatureDrawer` to use during canvas export.
- **JSON/Map**: Export the current state as raw data, which can be used later to restore the signature.
  - Data is exported with `timestamp` and `pressure` information for each point.

### Displaying an exported SVG file

You can display an exported SVG file using a library like [flutter_svg](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_svg).
